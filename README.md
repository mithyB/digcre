First you need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your computer.
Do this by downloading it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Then follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. run `npm install`
3. create a file `.env.local` containing this line:

   ```
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<add token here>
   ```

4. run `npm run dev`
   Now you should be able to access the page on http://localhost:3000
